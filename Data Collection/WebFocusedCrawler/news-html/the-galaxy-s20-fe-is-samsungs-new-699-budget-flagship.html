				<p class="p1">One thing Samsung knows for certain: it’s interested in budget flagships. The category makes sense these days, as users are increasingly unwilling to spend north of $1,000 on new phones. That’s doubly the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, with people leaving the house far less often and simply not possessing the same sort of disposable income they once had, amid economic slowdowns and widespread unemployment.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S20 Ultra is a lot of phone for a lot of money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/samsungs-galaxy-s20-ultra-is-a-lot-of-phone-for-a-lot-of-money/embed/#?secret=9s8nSQaJ7o" data-secret="9s8nSQaJ7o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">What’s less certain is how to position such a device. Samsung’s been through a lot of different names, including, most recently, the “Lite” line. That name made sense from a utility perspective. The S10 Lite was simply a lower-spec&#8217;d version of the flagship of similar name. Ultimately, however, I suspect that Samsung decided that pointing to the device’s shortcomings wasn’t ideal from a branding perspective, which is why we’re currently looking at the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE — or “Fan Edition.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2050282" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2050282" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2050282" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2050282" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">The name implies that the product is an update to the S20 aimed firmly at Samsung’s fans. Here’s what Mobile head TM Roh had to say about the new device: “We are constantly speaking to our fans and taking feedback, and we heard what they loved about our Galaxy S20 series, what features they used most often and what they would want new smartphone. The S20 FE is an extension of the Galaxy S20 family and is the start of a new way to bring meaningful innovation to even more people to let them do the things they love with the best of Galaxy.”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s true from a certain perspective. Samsung says it did some focus grouping to come up with the right combination for the FE, which I believe. It’s also probably true that “cheaper” was a big feature many folks have been looking for in their handsets in recent years, so from that standpoint, Samsung’s got fans’ numbers here &#8212; $699 for something approaching a flagship isn’t that bad, these days.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Samsung announces ‘Lite’ versions of the Galaxy S10 and Note 10&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/samsung-announces-lite-versions-of-the-galaxy-s10-and-note-10/embed/#?secret=QaebY6CBqo" data-secret="QaebY6CBqo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">And Samsung’s made a point to be mindful of the comprises it made here in the name of keeping the prices down. The biggest changes from the rest of the S20 series are a downgrade in materials, from a glass and metal to plastic (polycarbonate) design, display and camera specs. At 6.5 inches, the screen size actually falls between the S20 and S20+, but it’s been reduced from a QuadHD+ resolution to FHD+ — similar to what you’ll find on the Galaxy A71. The refresh rate stays at 120Hz, though the curved screen is gone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2050283" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2050283" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2050283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2050283" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">The S20’s 8GB of RAM has been reduced to 6GB, though the 128GB of standard storage remains the same. You’ll find the same Snapdragon 865 on board and, interestingly, the battery has actually been upgraded from 4,000mAh to 4,500mAh, owing to a larger device footprint. There are three rear-facing cameras, with the telephoto dropping from 64-megapixels down to eight — though the front-facing selfie cam has been upgraded from 10 megapixels to 32.</p>
<p class="p1">Not the latest and greatest, but in all, pretty reasonable compromises made in the name of shaving $300 off the device’s starting price. Pre-orders start today. The device starts shipping October 2.</p>

Earlier today, Micheal <a href=\"https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001213900-20-029922\/\">registered plans<\/a> with the SEC to raise $250 million in an IPO for a blank-check company that will broadly acquire a company in the tech sector.<\/p>\n<p>IPO Edge had reported <a href=\"http:\/\/ipo-edge.com\/2020\/10\/02\/former-uber-executive-emil-michael-to-file-for-250-million-spac-ipo-sources\/\">earlier today<\/a> that the SPAC might be in the works.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The filing lists as special advisors a bit of a rogue&#8217;s gallery, including Shervin Pishevar, an early Uber investor and advisor to the company who left his previous venture firm after being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-12-01\/uber-investor-shervin-pishevar-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women\">accused<\/a> by multiple women of sexual misconduct; Alphabet&#8217;s former executive chairman (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-7395939\/Married-billionaire-ex-Google-CEO-Eric-Schmidt-64-splits-latest-girlfriend-32.html\">erstwhile playboy<\/a>) Eric Schmidt; and Betsy Atkins, a founder of Ascend Communications and investor who has served on so many boards that last year she <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Be-Board-Ready-Secrets-Director\/dp\/1949709337\">wrote a book about it. <\/a>Indeed, among her other roles currently, she&#8217;s on the boards of Volvo, Wynn Resorts, and Oyo Hotels.<\/p>\n<p>Michael was a senior vice president of field operations at Tellme Networks, then later served as COO of the startup Klout before landing at Uber, where he was a senior vice president of business for nearly four years.<\/p>\n<p>He gained prominence in the role but also some disrepute after he publicly made comments about hiring opposition researchers to quiet journalists critical of the company and following a later report that he had attended an &#8220;escort bar&#8221; in Seoul with other Uber executives, including Kalanick. Indeed, when he left the company in 2017, Uber declined to say whether he left of his own accord.<\/p>\n<p>Despite &#8212; or perhaps even because of &#8212; his trajectory at Uber, Michael was reportedly vetted at one point for the position of Secretary of Transportation after Donald Trump was elected president. Now, he apparently sees a way to jump back into tech by using a SPAC to take public a still privately held company.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, we&#8217;re seeing the same trend with a small but growing number of tech companies, including electric vehicle makers, such as the troubled Nikola, and the electric-truck maker Hyliion, which revealed plans in August to go public through a reverse merger into a SPAC. (Nikola is already publicly traded; Hylion&#8217;s deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.)<\/p>\n<p>Companies in other sectors of the economy are seemingly up for grabs, too. Just yesterday, Hims, a direct-to-consumer company that sells health products and services targeted at young men and women, revealed that it will go public by merging with a SPAC sponsored by Oaktree Capital Management.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Opendoor,\u00a0 a home buying and selling platform, separately agreed to go public via a reverse merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp II, one of numerous SPACs that has been successfully raised by investor Chamath Palihapitiya.<\/p>\n<p>And in late August, Desktop Metal, a Burlington, Ma.-based maker of 3D metal printing systems, agreed to go public via a reverse merger with a SPAC formed last year by veteran telecom investor Leo Hindery, called Trine Acquisition Corp.<\/p>\n<p>Michael has a bit more M&amp;A experience than some who are beginning to take an interest in SPACs. For example, he was involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/12\/09\/senior-uber-exec-chinese-government-treated-us-fairly.html\">selling<\/a> Uber&#8217;s China business in 2016 to rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for a stake in the company.<\/p>\n<p>According to Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, she&#8217;s having, and hearing about, conversations with a much wider range of people interested in launching SPACs than in past years &#8212; and not all of them are necessarily equipped to manage the vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You ask, &#8216;Have you ever acquired a company for $500 million or more? Do you have operating experience in the vertical that you&#8217;re targeting? Do you understand the reporting requirements involved?&#8217; Often,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the answers are no.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>(Correction: an earlier version of this story did not list Shervin Pishevar as an advisor; we&#8217;d missed his involvement when scanning the filing originally.)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are all the rage right now, and people are emerging from all corners to raise them.

the<\/span> London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">closed its second seed fund<\/a> at

They include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, a peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets users create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, what sets <a href=\"https:\/\/kindredcapital.vc\/\">Kindred<\/a> apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;equitable venture&#8221; model that sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC\u2019s LPs have their investment returned, along with the firm\u2019s partners, the portfolio founders share any subsequent fund profits.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Kindred&#8217;s investment focus going forward and how its equitable venture model works in practice, I caught up with partners Leila Rastegar Zegna and Chrys Chrysanthou. We also discussed closing deals remotely and how the VC approaches diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kindredcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kindredcapital\">Kindred Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> backs seed-stage startups across Europe and in Israel. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit, such as sector or specific technologies, and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> As a fund, we are very focused on the founder(s), so everything starts there. We try to drill down and get to know them as people and leaders, first and foremost. Do they have what it takes to get the company off the ground, the resilience to get through the inevitable ups and downs of startup life and through the scaling years to make this a massive outcome for the team and the investors?<\/p>\n<p>The second element we spend time thinking about is the market itself and how big the company can grow within the constraints of that market. We also think deeply about the timing of the business, especially if they are trying to create a new market, such as in quantum computing, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/embed\/#?secret=MMV18DmUIx\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Chrysanthou:<\/strong> It\u2019s also worth mentioning that many investors talk about product-market fit, but we are also great believers in founder-market fit. In other words, a founder who might be successful in one market, might well fail in another, as different skills are required and even different personality types might be better suited. One way we assess this is to look for deep insights they have to the problem they\u2019re trying to solve and how they think about their market.<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are fairly sector-agnostic, which is why we have such a diverse portfolio, ranging from consumer products through to deep science.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns and social distancing affected the way you source and close deals?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> Initially, we moved everything to video calls, like pretty much everyone else in the industry. Upon reflection, however, we realized that we were just using a new tool (e.g. Zoom) but in the old way &#8212; meaning, any meeting we used to have at Kindred HQ, we just transitioned onto Zoom. The interesting transition we\u2019re going through now is to create a new way of working around the tool. That means for some meetings, Zoom will be the most effective medium of communication. For others it may be an audio call, and for a third category of discussion, a walking meeting in the park may be what\u2019s called for. But the opportunity is to throw out the playbook written by inertia and generally accepted industry working norms, and create a first principles approach to the way in which we do business to optimize for the best outcome.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kindred Capital, the London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.

While the more detailed language doesn\u2019t actually change the earlier policy\u2019s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don\u2019t currently use Google Play\u2019s billing system when selling digital goods in their app.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play\u2019s billing library.

In practice, that could mean Android phones that ship without Google apps, like Gmail or Drive, or iPhones without stock apps beyond those that offer core functionality, like the Camera.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, another clause would ban the tech companies from blocking rivals that offer their products to customers outside the gatekeeper&#8217;s own platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-eu-tech-antitrust\/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293\">Reuters reports<\/a>.

The category makes sense these days, as users are increasingly unwilling to spend north of $1,000 on new phones. That\u2019s doubly the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, with people leaving the house far less often and simply not possessing the same sort of disposable income they once had, amid economic slowdowns and widespread unemployment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9s8nSQaJ7o\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/samsungs-galaxy-s20-ultra-is-a-lot-of-phone-for-a-lot-of-money\/\">Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S20 Ultra is a lot of phone for a lot of money<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S20 Ultra is a lot of phone for a lot of money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/samsungs-galaxy-s20-ultra-is-a-lot-of-phone-for-a-lot-of-money\/embed\/#?secret=9s8nSQaJ7o\" data-secret=\"9s8nSQaJ7o\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">What\u2019s less certain is how to position such a device. Samsung\u2019s been through a lot of different names, including, most recently, the \u201cLite\u201d line. That name made sense from a utility perspective. The S10 Lite was simply a lower-spec&#8217;d version of the flagship of similar name. Ultimately, however, I suspect that Samsung decided that pointing to the device\u2019s shortcomings wasn\u2019t ideal from a branding perspective, which is why we\u2019re currently looking at the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE \u2014 or \u201cFan Edition.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050282\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050282\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2050282\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_All-Colors-2.jpg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Samsung<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The name implies that the product is an update to the S20 aimed firmly at Samsung\u2019s fans. Here\u2019s what Mobile head TM Roh had to say about the new device: \u201cWe are constantly speaking to our fans and taking feedback, and we heard what they loved about our Galaxy S20 series, what features they used most often and what they would want new smartphone. The S20 FE is an extension of the Galaxy S20 family and is the start of a new way to bring meaningful innovation to even more people to let them do the things they love with the best of Galaxy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s true from a certain perspective. Samsung says it did some focus grouping to come up with the right combination for the FE, which I believe. It\u2019s also probably true that \u201ccheaper\u201d was a big feature many folks have been looking for in their handsets in recent years, so from that standpoint, Samsung\u2019s got fans\u2019 numbers here &#8212; $699 for something approaching a flagship isn\u2019t that bad, these days.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QaebY6CBqo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/samsung-announces-lite-versions-of-the-galaxy-s10-and-note-10\/\">Samsung announces \u2018Lite\u2019 versions of the Galaxy S10 and Note 10<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Samsung announces \u2018Lite\u2019 versions of the Galaxy S10 and Note 10&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/samsung-announces-lite-versions-of-the-galaxy-s10-and-note-10\/embed\/#?secret=QaebY6CBqo\" data-secret=\"QaebY6CBqo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Samsung\u2019s made a point to be mindful of the comprises it made here in the name of keeping the prices down. The biggest changes from the rest of the S20 series are a downgrade in materials, from a glass and metal to plastic (polycarbonate) design, display and camera specs. At 6.5 inches, the screen size actually falls between the S20 and S20+, but it\u2019s been reduced from a QuadHD+ resolution to FHD+ \u2014 similar to what you\u2019ll find on the Galaxy A71. The refresh rate stays at 120Hz, though the curved screen is gone.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2050283\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050283\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2050283\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg 4500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Galaxy-S20-FE_Cloud-Red-Side.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2050283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Samsung<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The S20\u2019s 8GB of RAM has been reduced to 6GB, though the 128GB of standard storage remains the same. You\u2019ll find the same Snapdragon 865 on board and, interestingly, the battery has actually been upgraded from 4,000mAh to 4,500mAh, owing to a larger device footprint. There are three rear-facing cameras, with the telephoto dropping from 64-megapixels down to eight \u2014 though the front-facing selfie cam has been upgraded from 10 megapixels to 32.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not the latest and greatest, but in all, pretty reasonable compromises made in the name of shaving $300 off the device\u2019s starting price.
