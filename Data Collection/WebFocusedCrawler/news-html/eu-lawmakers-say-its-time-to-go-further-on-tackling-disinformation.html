				<p id="speakable-summary">A major European Commission review of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">Code of Practice</a> aimed at combating the spread of disinformation online has concluded the self-regulatory instrument is failing to deliver enough transparency or accountability from the tech platforms and advertisers signed up to it.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers suggested today that a <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">swathe of shortcomings identified with the current approach won&#8217;t be fixed without legally binding rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Although how exactly they will seek to tackle disinformation in forthcoming legislative packages, such as the Digital Services Act or the European Democracy Action Plan, remains to be seen.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Signatories to the Code of Practice on Disinformation include: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/tiktok-joins-the-eus-code-of-practice-on-disinformation/">TikTok</a> and Twitter, along with the trade association </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">representing online platforms (EDIMA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A number of trade associations representing the advertising industry and </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">advertisers are also signed up (namely: the European Association of Communications Agencies and the French, Czech, Polish and Danish national associations affiliated with it; the IAB Europe; and the </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">World Federation of Advertisers plus its Belgian national association, the Union of </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Belgian Advertisers)</span>.</p>
<p>“The Code of Practice has shown that online platforms and the advertising sector can do a lot to counter disinformation when they are put under public scrutiny. But platforms need to be more accountable and responsible; they need to become more transparent. The time has come to go beyond self-regulatory measures. Europe is best placed to lead the way and propose instruments for more resilient and fair democracy in an increasingly digital world,&#8221; said Věra Jourová, VP for values and transparency, commenting on the assessment of the code in a statement.</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Thierry Breton, commissioner for the Internal Market, added: “Organising and securing our digital information space has become a priority. The Code is a clear example of how public institutions can work more efficiently with tech companies to bring real benefits to our society. It is a unique tool for Europe to be assertive in the defence of its interests and values. Fighting disinformation is a shared responsibility, which the tech and advertising sector must fully assume.”</p>
<h2>Must do better</h2>
<p>On the positive side, the Commission review argues that the two-year-old Code of Practice on Disinformation has enabled <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;structured cooperation&#8221; with platforms which has boosted transparency and accountability (albeit, not enough), as well as providing a &#8220;useful&#8221; framework to monitor them and push for improvements in their policies on disinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And, indeed, t</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he Commission credits the Code with prompting &#8220;concrete actions and policy changes by the platforms aimed at countering disinformation&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>However the list of shortcomings identified by the review is long.</p>
<p>This is not surprising given the degree of wiggle room inherent in the approach, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">we said at the time it launched</a>. tl;dr: Getting adtech giants to agree to broad-brush commitments to do a vague something about a poorly defined set of interlinked issues vis-a-vis information shaping and manipulation gave plenty of space for platforms to cherry pick reported actions to make a show of &#8216;complying&#8217;. The Code also contains pretty glaring gaps.</p>
<p>Two years on the Commission agrees more effort is needed and commissioners said today it will take steps to address shortcomings in forthcoming legislative, without offering further detail.</p>
<p>The assessment groups the Code&#8217;s shortcomings into into four broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">inconsistent and incomplete application of the Code across platforms and Member States; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lack of uniform definitions; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">existence of several gaps in the coverage of the Code commitments; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">limitations intrinsic to the self-regulatory nature of the Code;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Among the laundry list of problematic issues it identifies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical disparities in what&#8217;s offered across EU Member States</li>
<li>Failure to distinguish between measures aimed at scrutinising ad placements on platforms&#8217; own sites vs third party sites</li>
<li>No sign of consistent implementation of restrictions on ad accounts promoting verified fake/misleading info</li>
<li>Questions over how well platforms are collaborating with third-party fact checkers and disinformation researchers</li>
<li>Questions over whether limits on ad placement are being enforced against websites that blatantly purvey misinformation</li>
<li>A lack of effective and joined up participation across the adtech chain to enable enforcement of ad placement limits against bad actors</li>
<li>Insufficiencies of implementation in &#8216;ad transparency&#8217; policies for political ads and issue ads</li>
<li>Failure to ensure disclosure labels remain on ads that are organically shared</li>
<li>Limited functionality of the APIs offered for ad archives, questions over the completeness and quality of the searchable information</li>
<li>A lack of uniform registration and authorisation procedures for political ads</li>
<li>Reporting on bot/fake account activity being aggregated and provided at a global level, with no ability to see reports at EU Member State level</li>
<li>A lack of reporting on bot/fake account activity involving domestic not foreign actors</li>
<li>Insufficient information about tools intended to help users find trustworthy content, including a lack of data to demonstrate efficacy</li>
<li>Lack of a universal, user-friendly mechanism for reporting disinformation and being adequately informed of the outcome</li>
<li>A lack of consistent use of fact-checkers across platforms and in all EU Member states and languages</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessment also identifies gaps in what the code covers &#8212; such as types of manipulative online behavior that fall outside the current scope (such as <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hack-and-leak operations; impersonation; the creation of fictitious groups or fake parody accounts; the theft of existing artefacts; deep fakes; the purchase of fake engagements; and the involvement of influencers).</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The experience gained through the monitoring of the Code shows that the scope of its commitments may be too narrow,&#8221; it suggests, adding: &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The vagueness of the Code’s commitments in this respect creates serious risks of incomplete action against disinformation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Microtargeting of political ads is also discussed in the assessment as a gap.</p>
<p>On this it writes:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>The Code presently does not prohibit micro-targeting or restrict the range of targeting criteria that platforms may offer with respect to paid-for political content, although one of the objectives set out for the Code in the April 2018 Communication was “restricting targeting options for political advertising.” Recent research shows that the vast majority of the public are opposed to the micro-targeting concerning certain content (including political advertising) or based on certain sensitive attributes (including political affiliation). Further reflections in this area will be pursued without prejudice to any future policy on micro-targeting of commercial ads.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Commission also notes that the European Cooperation Network on elections is &#8220;currently investigating the issue in depth&#8221;. &#8220;This work will inform the European Democracy Action Plan, which will look into the issue of micro-targeting in political campaigns to ensure greater transparency on paid political advertising,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The review also points to a major gap around the fairness of online political ads &#8212; given the lack of rules at EU level establishing spending limits for political advertising (or &#8220;addressing fair access to media for political parties or candidates participating in the elections to the European Parliament&#8221;), combined with a variable approach from platforms to whether or not they allow political ads.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 17">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;The issue of online application of laws in the electoral context and their modernisation is addressed in the work of the European Cooperation Network on Elections. The European Democracy Action Plan will look into solutions to ensure greater transparency of paid political advertising as well as clearer rules on the financing of European political parties,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Another major deficiency of the code the Commission assessment identifies is the lack of adequate key performance indicators to enable effective monitoring.</p>
<p>The Commission further identifies a number of inherent limits to the self-regulatory approach &#8212; such as a lack of universal participation creating inequalities and variable compliance; and the lack of an independent oversight mechanism for monitoring performance.</p>
<p>It also highlights concerns about risks to fundamental rights from the current approach &#8212; such as the lack of a complaints procedure or other remedies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission suggests a number of improvements for the code &#8212; such as &#8220;commonly-shared definitions, clearer procedures, more precise commitments and transparent key performance indicators and appropriate monitoring&#8221; &#8212; as well as calling for further effort to broaden participation, in particular from the advertising sector.</p>
<p>It also wants to see a more <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">structured model for cooperation between platforms and the research community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;At present, it remains difficult to precisely assess the timeliness, comprehensiveness and impact of platforms’ actions, as the Commission and public authorities are still very much reliant on the willingness of platforms to share information and data. The lack of access to data allowing for an independent evaluation of emerging trends and threats posed by online disinformation, as well as the absence of meaningful KPIs to assess the effectiveness of platforms’ policies to counter the phenomenon, is a fundamental shortcoming of the current Code,&#8221; it notes. </span></p>

<p>&#8220;A structured monitoring programme may constitute a pragmatic way to mobilise the platforms and secure their accountability. The programme for monitoring disinformation around COVID-19 foreseen in the June 2020 Communication will be an opportunity to verify the adequacy of such an approach and prepare the ground for further reflection on the best way forward in the fight to disinformation,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1352">consultation</a> on the Commission&#8217;s European Democracy Action plan concludes next week &#8212; and that&#8217;s one vehicle where it might seek to set down more fixed and measurable counter-disinformation requirements.</p>
<p>The Digital Services Act, meanwhile, which is slated to tackle platform responsibilities, is due in draft by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>First COVID-19 disinformation reports</h3>
<p>Also today the Commission has published the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-baseline-reports-fighting-covid-19-disinformation-monitoring-programme">first monthly reports</a> of action taken against coronavirus-related disinformation by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitter and Mozilla.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">June</a> it pressed platforms for more detailed data on actions being taken to promote authoritative content; improve users’ awareness; and limit coronavirus disinformation and advertising related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, they show that the signatories to the Code have stepped up their efforts,&#8221; the Commission writes today, noting that all platforms have increased the visibility of authoritative sources &#8212; by giving prominence to COVID-19 information from the WHO and national health organisations, and by deploying &#8220;new tools and services to facilitate access to relevant and reliable information relating to the evolution of the crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although here, too, it notes that some of the products or services were not deployed in all EU countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms have stepped up their efforts to detect cases of social media manipulation and malign influence operations or coordinated inauthentic behaviour. While platforms detected a high number of content including false information related to COVID-19, they did not detect coordinated disinformation operations with specific focus on COVID-19 run on their services,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>On ads the third party sites purveying COVID-19 disinformation it says the reports highlight &#8220;robust actions&#8221; taken to limit the flow of advertising, while providing free COVID-related ads space to government and healthcare organisations.</p>

Indeed, when he left the company in 2017, Uber declined to say whether he left of his own accord.<\/p>\n<p>Despite &#8212; or perhaps even because of &#8212; his trajectory at Uber, Michael was reportedly vetted at one point for the position of Secretary of Transportation after Donald Trump was elected president. Now, he apparently sees a way to jump back into tech by using a SPAC to take public a still privately held company.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, we&#8217;re seeing the same trend with a small but growing number of tech companies, including electric vehicle makers, such as the troubled Nikola, and the electric-truck maker Hyliion, which revealed plans in August to go public through a reverse merger into a SPAC. (Nikola is already publicly traded; Hylion&#8217;s deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.)<\/p>\n<p>Companies in other sectors of the economy are seemingly up for grabs, too. Just yesterday, Hims, a direct-to-consumer company that sells health products and services targeted at young men and women, revealed that it will go public by merging with a SPAC sponsored by Oaktree Capital Management.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Opendoor,\u00a0 a home buying and selling platform, separately agreed to go public via a reverse merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp II, one of numerous SPACs that has been successfully raised by investor Chamath Palihapitiya.<\/p>\n<p>And in late August, Desktop Metal, a Burlington, Ma.-based maker of 3D metal printing systems, agreed to go public via a reverse merger with a SPAC formed last year by veteran telecom investor Leo Hindery, called Trine Acquisition Corp.<\/p>\n<p>Michael has a bit more M&amp;A experience than some who are beginning to take an interest in SPACs. For example, he was involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/12\/09\/senior-uber-exec-chinese-government-treated-us-fairly.html\">selling<\/a> Uber&#8217;s China business in 2016 to rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for a stake in the company.<\/p>\n<p>According to Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, she&#8217;s having, and hearing about, conversations with a much wider range of people interested in launching SPACs than in past years &#8212; and not all of them are necessarily equipped to manage the vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You ask, &#8216;Have you ever acquired a company for $500 million or more? Do you have operating experience in the vertical that you&#8217;re targeting?

the<\/span> London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">closed its second seed fund<\/a> at \u00a381 million.<\/p>\n<p>Out if its first fund raised in 2018, the firm has backed 29 companies. They include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, a peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets users create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, what sets <a href=\"https:\/\/kindredcapital.vc\/\">Kindred<\/a> apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;equitable venture&#8221; model that sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC\u2019s LPs have their investment returned, along with the firm\u2019s partners, the portfolio founders share any subsequent fund profits.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Kindred&#8217;s investment focus going forward and how its equitable venture model works in practice, I caught up with partners Leila Rastegar Zegna and Chrys Chrysanthou. We also discussed closing deals remotely and how the VC approaches diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kindredcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kindredcapital\">Kindred Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> backs seed-stage startups across Europe and in Israel. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit, such as sector or specific technologies, and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> As a fund, we are very focused on the founder(s), so everything starts there. We try to drill down and get to know them as people and leaders, first and foremost. Do they have what it takes to get the company off the ground, the resilience to get through the inevitable ups and downs of startup life and through the scaling years to make this a massive outcome for the team and the investors?<\/p>\n<p>The second element we spend time thinking about is the market itself and how big the company can grow within the constraints of that market. We also think deeply about the timing of the business, especially if they are trying to create a new market, such as in quantum computing, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/embed\/#?secret=MMV18DmUIx\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Chrysanthou:<\/strong> It\u2019s also worth mentioning that many investors talk about product-market fit, but we are also great believers in founder-market fit. In other words, a founder who might be successful in one market, might well fail in another, as different skills are required and even different personality types might be better suited. One way we assess this is to look for deep insights they have to the problem they\u2019re trying to solve and how they think about their market.<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are fairly sector-agnostic, which is why we have such a diverse portfolio, ranging from consumer products through to deep science.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns and social distancing affected the way you source and close deals?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> Initially, we moved everything to video calls, like pretty much everyone else in the industry. Upon reflection, however, we realized that we were just using a new tool (e.g. Zoom) but in the old way &#8212; meaning, any meeting we used to have at Kindred HQ, we just transitioned onto Zoom. The interesting transition we\u2019re going through now is to create a new way of working around the tool. That means for some meetings, Zoom will be the most effective medium of communication. For others it may be an audio call, and for a third category of discussion, a walking meeting in the park may be what\u2019s called for.

While the more detailed language doesn\u2019t actually change the earlier policy\u2019s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don\u2019t currently use Google Play\u2019s billing system when selling digital goods in their app.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play\u2019s billing library. That means there\u2019s only a small percentage of apps that will need to come into compliance under the clarified terms.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"A35o7ZuF5Z\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/15\/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion\/\">App stores saw record 204 billion app downloads in 2019, consumer spend of $120 billion<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;App stores saw record 204 billion app downloads in 2019, consumer spend of $120 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/15\/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion\/embed\/#?secret=A35o7ZuF5Z\" data-secret=\"A35o7ZuF5Z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The rules seem to want to bring into compliance larger services skirting in-app purchase rules, like Netflix and Spotify.

One measure, detailed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/1773edd6-7f1d-4290-93b6-05965a4ff0db\">The Financial Times,<\/a>\u00a0says platforms can&#8217;t use the data they collect for their own commercial activities <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/10\/01\/eu-could-force-apple-to-share-user-data-with-competitors\">unless that&#8217;s shared<\/a> with businesses pursuing the same activities.<\/p>\n<p>The draft also currently recommends that big tech companies could be prohibited from favoring their own services on their websites and platforms, meaning they couldn&#8217;t pre-install their own apps on laptops or phones, or forced businesses to pre-install their apps to gain access to their platform. In practice, that could mean Android phones that ship without Google apps, like Gmail or Drive, or iPhones without stock apps beyond those that offer core functionality, like the Camera.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, another clause would ban the tech companies from blocking rivals that offer their products to customers outside the gatekeeper&#8217;s own platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-eu-tech-antitrust\/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293\">Reuters reports<\/a>.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/26\/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news\/\">Code of Practice<\/a> aimed at combating the spread of disinformation online has concluded the self-regulatory instrument is failing to deliver enough transparency or accountability from the tech platforms and advertisers signed up to it.<\/p>\n<p>EU lawmakers suggested today that a <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">swathe of shortcomings identified with the current approach won&#8217;t be fixed without legally binding rules. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Although how exactly they will seek to tackle disinformation in forthcoming legislative packages, such as the Digital Services Act or the European Democracy Action Plan, remains to be seen.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Signatories to the Code of Practice on Disinformation include: <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/tiktok-joins-the-eus-code-of-practice-on-disinformation\/\">TikTok<\/a> and Twitter, along with the trade association <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">representing online platforms (EDIMA).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">A number of trade associations representing the advertising industry and <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">advertisers are also signed up (namely: the European Association of Communications Agencies and the French, Czech, Polish and Danish national associations affiliated with it; the IAB Europe; and the <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">World Federation of Advertisers plus its Belgian national association, the Union of <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Belgian Advertisers)<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Code of Practice has shown that online platforms and the advertising sector can do a lot to counter disinformation when they are put under public scrutiny. But platforms need to be more accountable and responsible; they need to become more transparent. The time has come to go beyond self-regulatory measures. Europe is best placed to lead the way and propose instruments for more resilient and fair democracy in an increasingly digital world,&#8221; said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, VP for values and transparency, commenting on the assessment of the code in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>In another supporting statement, Thierry Breton, commissioner for the Internal Market, added: \u201cOrganising and securing our digital information space has become a priority. The Code is a clear example of how public institutions can work more efficiently with tech companies to bring real benefits to our society. It is a unique tool for Europe to be assertive in the defence of its interests and values. Fighting disinformation is a shared responsibility, which the tech and advertising sector must fully assume.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Must do better<\/h2>\n<p>On the positive side, the Commission review argues that the two-year-old Code of Practice on Disinformation has enabled <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;structured cooperation&#8221; with platforms which has boosted transparency and accountability (albeit, not enough), as well as providing a &#8220;useful&#8221; framework to monitor them and push for improvements in their policies on disinformation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">And, indeed, t<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he Commission credits the Code with prompting &#8220;concrete actions and policy changes by the platforms aimed at countering disinformation&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>However the list of shortcomings identified by the review is long.<\/p>\n<p>This is not surprising given the degree of wiggle room inherent in the approach, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/26\/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news\/\">we said at the time it launched<\/a>. tl;dr: Getting adtech giants to agree to broad-brush commitments to do a vague something about a poorly defined set of interlinked issues vis-a-vis information shaping and manipulation gave plenty of space for platforms to cherry pick reported actions to make a show of &#8216;complying&#8217;. The Code also contains pretty glaring gaps.<\/p>\n<p>Two years on the Commission agrees more effort is needed and commissioners said today it will take steps to address shortcomings in forthcoming legislative, without offering further detail.<\/p>\n<p>The assessment groups the Code&#8217;s shortcomings into into four broad categories:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">inconsistent and incomplete application of the Code across platforms and Member States; <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">lack of uniform definitions; <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">existence of several gaps in the coverage of the Code commitments; <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">limitations intrinsic to the self-regulatory nature of the Code;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Among the laundry list of problematic issues it identifies are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical disparities in what&#8217;s offered across EU Member States<\/li>\n<li>Failure to distinguish between measures aimed at scrutinising ad placements on platforms&#8217; own sites vs third party sites<\/li>\n<li>No sign of consistent implementation of restrictions on ad accounts promoting verified fake\/misleading info<\/li>\n<li>Questions over how well platforms are collaborating with third-party fact checkers and disinformation researchers<\/li>\n<li>Questions over whether limits on ad placement are being enforced against websites that blatantly purvey misinformation<\/li>\n<li>A lack of effective and joined up participation across the adtech chain to enable enforcement of ad placement limits against bad actors<\/li>\n<li>Insufficiencies of implementation in &#8216;ad transparency&#8217; policies for political ads and issue ads<\/li>\n<li>Failure to ensure disclosure labels remain on ads that are organically shared<\/li>\n<li>Limited functionality of the APIs offered for ad archives, questions over the completeness and quality of the searchable information<\/li>\n<li>A lack of uniform registration and authorisation procedures for political ads<\/li>\n<li>Reporting on bot\/fake account activity being aggregated and provided at a global level, with no ability to see reports at EU Member State level<\/li>\n<li>A lack of reporting on bot\/fake account activity involving domestic not foreign actors<\/li>\n<li>Insufficient information about tools intended to help users find trustworthy content, including a lack of data to demonstrate efficacy<\/li>\n<li>Lack of a universal, user-friendly mechanism for reporting disinformation and being adequately informed of the outcome<\/li>\n<li>A lack of consistent use of fact-checkers across platforms and in all EU Member states and languages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The assessment also identifies gaps in what the code covers &#8212; such as types of manipulative online behavior that fall outside the current scope (such as <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">hack-and-leak operations; impersonation; the creation of fictitious groups or fake parody accounts; the theft of existing artefacts; deep fakes; the purchase of fake engagements; and the involvement of influencers).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The experience gained through the monitoring of the Code shows that the scope of its commitments may be too narrow,&#8221; it suggests, adding: &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The vagueness of the Code\u2019s commitments in this respect creates serious risks of incomplete action against disinformation.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Microtargeting of political ads is also discussed in the assessment as a gap.<\/p>\n<p>On this it writes:<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<blockquote><p>The Code presently does not prohibit micro-targeting or restrict the range of targeting criteria that platforms may offer with respect to paid-for political content, although one of the objectives set out for the Code in the April 2018 Communication was \u201crestricting targeting options for political advertising.\u201d Recent research shows that the vast majority of the public are opposed to the micro-targeting concerning certain content (including political advertising) or based on certain sensitive attributes (including political affiliation). Further reflections in this area will be pursued without prejudice to any future policy on micro-targeting of commercial ads.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The Commission also notes that the European Cooperation Network on elections is &#8220;currently investigating the issue in depth&#8221;. &#8220;This work will inform the European Democracy Action Plan, which will look into the issue of micro-targeting in political campaigns to ensure greater transparency on paid political advertising,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The review also points to a major gap around the fairness of online political ads &#8212; given the lack of rules at EU level establishing spending limits for political advertising (or &#8220;addressing fair access to media for political parties or candidates participating in the elections to the European Parliament&#8221;), combined with a variable approach from platforms to whether or not they allow political ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 17\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;The issue of online application of laws in the electoral context and their modernisation is addressed in the work of the European Cooperation Network on Elections. The European Democracy Action Plan will look into solutions to ensure greater transparency of paid political advertising as well as clearer rules on the financing of European political parties,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>Another major deficiency of the code the Commission assessment identifies is the lack of adequate key performance indicators to enable effective monitoring.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission further identifies a number of inherent limits to the self-regulatory approach &#8212; such as a lack of universal participation creating inequalities and variable compliance; and the lack of an independent oversight mechanism for monitoring performance.<\/p>\n<p>It also highlights concerns about risks to fundamental rights from the current approach &#8212; such as the lack of a complaints procedure or other remedies.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, the Commission suggests a number of improvements for the code &#8212; such as &#8220;commonly-shared definitions, clearer procedures, more precise commitments and transparent key performance indicators and appropriate monitoring&#8221; &#8212; as well as calling for further effort to broaden participation, in particular from the advertising sector.<\/p>\n<p>It also wants to see a more <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">structured model for cooperation between platforms and the research community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;At present, it remains difficult to precisely assess the timeliness, comprehensiveness and impact of platforms\u2019 actions, as the Commission and public authorities are still very much reliant on the willingness of platforms to share information and data. The lack of access to data allowing for an independent evaluation of emerging trends and threats posed by online disinformation, as well as the absence of meaningful KPIs to assess the effectiveness of platforms\u2019 policies to counter the phenomenon, is a fundamental shortcoming of the current Code,&#8221; it notes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 20\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;A structured monitoring programme may constitute a pragmatic way to mobilise the platforms and secure their accountability. The programme for monitoring disinformation around COVID-19 foreseen in the June 2020 Communication will be an opportunity to verify the adequacy of such an approach and prepare the ground for further reflection on the best way forward in the fight to disinformation,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1352\">consultation<\/a> on the Commission&#8217;s European Democracy Action plan concludes next week &#8212; and that&#8217;s one vehicle where it might seek to set down more fixed and measurable counter-disinformation requirements.<\/p>\n<p>The Digital Services Act, meanwhile, which is slated to tackle platform responsibilities, is due in draft by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<h3>First COVID-19 disinformation reports<\/h3>\n<p>Also today the Commission has published the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/news\/first-baseline-reports-fighting-covid-19-disinformation-monitoring-programme\">first monthly reports<\/a> of action taken against coronavirus-related disinformation by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitter and Mozilla.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers\/\">June<\/a> it pressed platforms for more detailed data on actions being taken to promote authoritative content; improve users\u2019 awareness; and limit coronavirus disinformation and advertising related to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, they show that the signatories to the Code have stepped up their efforts,&#8221; the Commission writes today, noting that all platforms have increased the visibility of authoritative sources &#8212; by giving prominence to COVID-19 information from the WHO and national health organisations, and by deploying &#8220;new tools and services to facilitate access to relevant and reliable information relating to the evolution of the crisis&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Although here, too, it notes that some of the products or services were not deployed in all EU countries.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Platforms have stepped up their efforts to detect cases of social media manipulation and malign influence operations or coordinated inauthentic behaviour. While platforms detected a high number of content including false information related to COVID-19, they did not detect coordinated disinformation operations with specific focus on COVID-19 run on their services,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>On ads the third party sites purveying COVID-19 disinformation it says the reports\u00a0highlight &#8220;robust actions&#8221; taken to limit the flow of advertising, while providing free COVID-related ads space to government and healthcare organisations.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A major European Commission review of a Code of Practice aimed at combating the spread of disinformation online has concluded the self-regulatory instrument is failing to deliver enough transparency or accountability from the tech platforms and advertisers signed up to it.
