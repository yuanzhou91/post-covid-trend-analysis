				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://en.nature.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nature</a>, a Japanese hardware startup that focuses on IoT home devices, announced the launch of <a href="https://en.nature.global/nature-remo-3/">Nature Remo 3</a>, its home appliance smart remote, in the United States and Canada today. Priced at $129, the Bluetooth-enabled Nature Remo 3 allows people to control with their smartphones or smart speakers multiple appliances that use an infrared remote, including air conditioners, TVs, robot vacuum cleaners and fans.</p>
<p>Nature claims that its Remo series is Japan’s top smart remote, with more than 200,000 units sold so far. The Nature Remo 3, designed to be mounted on a wall, also has sensors for temperature, humidity, lighting and movement, allowing users to create customized settings for when they want devices to turn on or shut off. Nature Remo 3’s app also has a GPS location feature, so appliances can turn on automatically as users get closer to their homes.</p>
<p>As COVID-19 forces people to spend more time at home than usual, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200723005099/en/Home-Improvement-Activity-Increases-During-COVID-19">many are embarking on home improvement projects</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even though people may be reluctant to purchase new appliances because of the economic downturn, relatively inexpensive products like the Nature Remo 3 may still attract buyers because it can help reduce energy consumed by devices they already own. The Nature Remo 3 also adds another layer of functionality to smart speakers and before the pandemic, global smart speaker sales <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/smart-speaker-sales-reached-new-record-of-146-9m-in-2019-up-70-from-2018/">hit a record high last year, with 146.9 million units shipped</a>. The Nature Remo 3 is compatible with Amazon smart speakers like the Echo Dot, as well as Google Home and Apple HomePod speakers.</p>
<p>Nature founder and chief executive Haruumi Shiode told TechCrunch that Nature conducted a pilot with Kansai Electric, one of the largest utility providers in Japan, to prove that it can lower the amount of electricity used by air conditioners. He added that the pandemic actually accelerated sales of Nature Remo devices in Japan and prompted the company’s decision to launch in the U.S.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made mass-producing the Nature Remo 3 more challenging because Nature’s team was no longer able to make monthly trips to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shenzhen-eb7c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shenzhen-eb7c">Shenzhen, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Shiode said. But the Nature Remo 3 is the sixth product Nature has launched so far, so it was able to figure out how to work with factories remotely on production and quality assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read that since the pandemic started, 70% of Americans are tackling home improvement projects,&#8221; Shiode added. &#8220;Similarly, people around the world have been looking for ways to make their shelter-in-place less mundane and more convenient. With the Nature Remo 3, we hope to offer the same convenience and efficiencies to the American market as we have in Japan.&#8221;</p>

Earlier today, Micheal <a href=\"https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001213900-20-029922\/\">registered plans<\/a> with the SEC to raise $250 million in an IPO for a blank-check company that will broadly acquire a company in the tech sector.<\/p>\n<p>IPO Edge had reported <a href=\"http:\/\/ipo-edge.com\/2020\/10\/02\/former-uber-executive-emil-michael-to-file-for-250-million-spac-ipo-sources\/\">earlier today<\/a> that the SPAC might be in the works.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The filing lists as special advisors a bit of a rogue&#8217;s gallery, including Shervin Pishevar, an early Uber investor and advisor to the company who left his previous venture firm after being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-12-01\/uber-investor-shervin-pishevar-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women\">accused<\/a> by multiple women of sexual misconduct; Alphabet&#8217;s former executive chairman (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-7395939\/Married-billionaire-ex-Google-CEO-Eric-Schmidt-64-splits-latest-girlfriend-32.html\">erstwhile playboy<\/a>) Eric Schmidt; and Betsy Atkins, a founder of Ascend Communications and investor who has served on so many boards that last year she <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Be-Board-Ready-Secrets-Director\/dp\/1949709337\">wrote a book about it. <\/a>Indeed, among her other roles currently, she&#8217;s on the boards of Volvo, Wynn Resorts, and Oyo Hotels.<\/p>\n<p>Michael was a senior vice president of field operations at Tellme Networks, then later served as COO of the startup Klout before landing at Uber, where he was a senior vice president of business for nearly four years.<\/p>\n<p>He gained prominence in the role but also some disrepute after he publicly made comments about hiring opposition researchers to quiet journalists critical of the company and following a later report that he had attended an &#8220;escort bar&#8221; in Seoul with other Uber executives, including Kalanick. Indeed, when he left the company in 2017, Uber declined to say whether he left of his own accord.<\/p>\n<p>Despite &#8212; or perhaps even because of &#8212; his trajectory at Uber, Michael was reportedly vetted at one point for the position of Secretary of Transportation after Donald Trump was elected president. Now, he apparently sees a way to jump back into tech by using a SPAC to take public a still privately held company.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, we&#8217;re seeing the same trend with a small but growing number of tech companies, including electric vehicle makers, such as the troubled Nikola, and the electric-truck maker Hyliion, which revealed plans in August to go public through a reverse merger into a SPAC. (Nikola is already publicly traded; Hylion&#8217;s deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.)<\/p>\n<p>Companies in other sectors of the economy are seemingly up for grabs, too. Just yesterday, Hims, a direct-to-consumer company that sells health products and services targeted at young men and women, revealed that it will go public by merging with a SPAC sponsored by Oaktree Capital Management.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Opendoor,\u00a0 a home buying and selling platform, separately agreed to go public via a reverse merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp II, one of numerous SPACs that has been successfully raised by investor Chamath Palihapitiya.<\/p>\n<p>And in late August, Desktop Metal, a Burlington, Ma.-based maker of 3D metal printing systems, agreed to go public via a reverse merger with a SPAC formed last year by veteran telecom investor Leo Hindery, called Trine Acquisition Corp.<\/p>\n<p>Michael has a bit more M&amp;A experience than some who are beginning to take an interest in SPACs. For example, he was involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/12\/09\/senior-uber-exec-chinese-government-treated-us-fairly.html\">selling<\/a> Uber&#8217;s China business in 2016 to rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for a stake in the company.<\/p>\n<p>According to Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who now runs the data site <a href=\"https:\/\/spacinsider.com\/\">SPACInsider<\/a>, she&#8217;s having, and hearing about, conversations with a much wider range of people interested in launching SPACs than in past years &#8212; and not all of them are necessarily equipped to manage the vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You ask, &#8216;Have you ever acquired a company for $500 million or more? Do you have operating experience in the vertical that you&#8217;re targeting? Do you understand the reporting requirements involved?&#8217; Often,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the answers are no.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>(Correction: an earlier version of this story did not list Shervin Pishevar as an advisor; we&#8217;d missed his involvement when scanning the filing originally.)<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are all the rage right now, and people are emerging from all corners to raise them.

the<\/span> London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">closed its second seed fund<\/a> at \u00a381 million.<\/p>\n<p>Out if its first fund raised in 2018, the firm has backed 29 companies. They include Five, which is building software for autonomous vehicles; Paddle, SaaS for software e-commerce; Pollen, a peer-to-peer marketplace for experiences and travel; and Farewill, which lets users create a will online.<\/p>\n<p>However, what sets <a href=\"https:\/\/kindredcapital.vc\/\">Kindred<\/a> apart from most other seed VCs is its &#8220;equitable venture&#8221; model that sees the founders it backs get carry in the fund, effectively becoming co-owners of Kindred. Once the VC\u2019s LPs have their investment returned, along with the firm\u2019s partners, the portfolio founders share any subsequent fund profits.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Kindred&#8217;s investment focus going forward and how its equitable venture model works in practice, I caught up with partners Leila Rastegar Zegna and Chrys Chrysanthou. We also discussed closing deals remotely and how the VC approaches diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kindredcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kindredcapital\">Kindred Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> backs seed-stage startups across Europe and in Israel. Can you elaborate a bit more on the fund\u2019s remit, such as sector or specific technologies, and what you look for in founders and startups at such an early stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> As a fund, we are very focused on the founder(s), so everything starts there. We try to drill down and get to know them as people and leaders, first and foremost. Do they have what it takes to get the company off the ground, the resilience to get through the inevitable ups and downs of startup life and through the scaling years to make this a massive outcome for the team and the investors?<\/p>\n<p>The second element we spend time thinking about is the market itself and how big the company can grow within the constraints of that market. We also think deeply about the timing of the business, especially if they are trying to create a new market, such as in quantum computing, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/\">Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kindred Capital closes \u00a381M second fund to back early-stage European startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/20\/kindred-capital-ii\/embed\/#?secret=MMV18DmUIx\" data-secret=\"MMV18DmUIx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Chrysanthou:<\/strong> It\u2019s also worth mentioning that many investors talk about product-market fit, but we are also great believers in founder-market fit. In other words, a founder who might be successful in one market, might well fail in another, as different skills are required and even different personality types might be better suited. One way we assess this is to look for deep insights they have to the problem they\u2019re trying to solve and how they think about their market.<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are fairly sector-agnostic, which is why we have such a diverse portfolio, ranging from consumer products through to deep science.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns and social distancing affected the way you source and close deals?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastegar Zegna:<\/strong> Initially, we moved everything to video calls, like pretty much everyone else in the industry. Upon reflection, however, we realized that we were just using a new tool (e.g. Zoom) but in the old way &#8212; meaning, any meeting we used to have at Kindred HQ, we just transitioned onto Zoom. The interesting transition we\u2019re going through now is to create a new way of working around the tool. That means for some meetings, Zoom will be the most effective medium of communication. For others it may be an audio call, and for a third category of discussion, a walking meeting in the park may be what\u2019s called for. But the opportunity is to throw out the playbook written by inertia and generally accepted industry working norms, and create a first principles approach to the way in which we do business to optimize for the best outcome.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kindred Capital, the London-based VC that backs early-stage founders in Europe and Israel, recently closed its second seed fund at \u00a381 million.

While the more detailed language doesn\u2019t actually change the earlier policy\u2019s intention, it will impact a percentage of developers who don\u2019t currently use Google Play\u2019s billing system when selling digital goods in their app.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the company announced it will make changes in Android 12 that will make it easier for users to install and use third-party app stores as an alternative to Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>The company says that its current\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/9858738\">billing policies<\/a> only apply to less than 3% of apps on Google Play. Of those apps, 97% already use Google Play\u2019s billing library.

In practice, that could mean Android phones that ship without Google apps, like Gmail or Drive, or iPhones without stock apps beyond those that offer core functionality, like the Camera.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, another clause would ban the tech companies from blocking rivals that offer their products to customers outside the gatekeeper&#8217;s own platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-eu-tech-antitrust\/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293\">Reuters reports<\/a>.

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nature<\/a>, a Japanese hardware startup that focuses on IoT home devices, announced the launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.nature.global\/nature-remo-3\/\">Nature Remo 3<\/a>, its home appliance smart remote, in the United States and Canada today. Priced at $129, the Bluetooth-enabled Nature Remo 3 allows people to control with their smartphones or smart speakers multiple appliances that use an infrared remote, including air conditioners, TVs, robot vacuum cleaners and fans.<\/p>\n<p>Nature claims that its Remo series is Japan\u2019s top smart remote, with more than 200,000 units sold so far. The Nature Remo 3, designed to be mounted on a wall, also has sensors for temperature, humidity, lighting and movement, allowing users to create customized settings for when they want devices to turn on or shut off. Nature Remo 3\u2019s app also has a GPS location feature, so appliances can turn on automatically as users get closer to their homes.<\/p>\n<p>As COVID-19 forces people to spend more time at home than usual, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200723005099\/en\/Home-Improvement-Activity-Increases-During-COVID-19\">many are embarking on home improvement projects<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Even though people may be reluctant to purchase new appliances because of the economic downturn, relatively inexpensive products like the Nature Remo 3 may still attract buyers because it can help reduce energy consumed by devices they already own. The Nature Remo 3 also adds another layer of functionality to smart speakers and before the pandemic, global smart speaker sales <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/17\/smart-speaker-sales-reached-new-record-of-146-9m-in-2019-up-70-from-2018\/\">hit a record high last year, with 146.9 million units shipped<\/a>. The Nature Remo 3 is compatible with Amazon smart speakers like the Echo Dot, as well as Google Home and Apple HomePod speakers.<\/p>\n<p>Nature founder and chief executive Haruumi Shiode told TechCrunch that Nature conducted a pilot with Kansai Electric, one of the largest utility providers in Japan, to prove that it can lower the amount of electricity used by air conditioners. He added that the pandemic actually accelerated sales of Nature Remo devices in Japan and prompted the company\u2019s decision to launch in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made mass-producing the Nature Remo 3 more challenging because Nature\u2019s team was no longer able to make monthly trips to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/shenzhen-eb7c\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shenzhen-eb7c\">Shenzhen, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Shiode said. But the Nature Remo 3 is the sixth product Nature has launched so far, so it was able to figure out how to work with factories remotely on production and quality assurance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I read that since the pandemic started, 70% of Americans are tackling home improvement projects,&#8221; Shiode added. &#8220;Similarly, people around the world have been looking for ways to make their shelter-in-place less mundane and more convenient. With the Nature Remo 3, we hope to offer the same convenience and efficiencies to the American market as we have in Japan.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nature, a Japanese hardware startup that focuses on IoT home devices, announced the launch of Nature Remo 3, its home appliance smart remote, in the United States and Canada today.
